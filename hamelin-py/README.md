These are some sample implementations of `hamelin`-compliant daemons for
Python. You can install them by `cd`ing into this directory (`/hamelin-py`) and
running `pip install` (or, if you're intrepid, `python setup.py install`).

If you're like me, though, you're more than welcome to just clone this
directory and add `/download-dir/hamelin-py/hamelin/` to your `$PATH`.

A decent installer for all hamelin plugins is coming soon. Stay tuned.
